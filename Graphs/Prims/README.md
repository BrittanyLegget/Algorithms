# Description

Minimum Spanning tree solved using Prim's algorithm.

# What is a Minimum Spanning Tree?

Given a weighted undirected graph G, the minimum spanning tree is that spanning tree of G whose cost (the sum of weights of edges) is the least among any other spanning tree of G.

### Prim's Algorithm

Prim's algorithm picks a random node in the graph and builds the spanning tree by using the greedy approach of selecting the edge with the least weight.
